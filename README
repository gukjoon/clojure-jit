# clojurejit

Adds a just in time compilation gen-class that takes method implementations in-line instead of having them defined separately. This requires clojure 1.2.0 

## Usage

Interface is exactly like the gen-class macro (http://richhickey.github.com/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/gen-class), except without the following keywords:
* prefix
* impl-ns 
* load-impl-ns

The input to the methods keyword is still a vector of vectors, but needs 4 elements: name, parameter types, return type, and method implementation as a function.

## Installation

lein deps
lein javac
lein jar

## License

Err... none?
